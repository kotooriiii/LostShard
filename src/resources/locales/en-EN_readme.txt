== Multi-prefixes and -suffixes

!!!This feature is only available, if you have PermissionsEx installed!!!

If you have Multi-prefixes/suffixes enabled, the prefix will be set to the prefixes/suffixes of ALL groups the player is in.
Example:

You have two groups:
Owner and Moderator.

The prefix of Owner is '&4Owner ' and the prefix of Moderator is '&9Moderator '.
You are in the owner AND in the moderator group.
Your prefix in chat will be: '&4Owner &9Moderator '.
If you now have a special prefix only for you, it will be added to the prefix in chat, too.
