IMPORTANT: Careless editing with the following Guard files can cause CORRUPTED DATA,
which can remove or tamper with your Guard in-game. PLEASE TAKE CAUTION IF YOU STILL WISH TO EDIT THESE FILES.

Most of the time, if you wish to edit Guard information it is best to do so in-game by staff commands.
Only EDIT when the server is offline. Editing while server is online will not save any changes
you made to the file.

The format follows as:
the name of the file is the name of the Guard [You are allowed to change, however, make sure no Guards carry duplicate names.]
opening the file in notepad++ gives you many attributes
here you can change the guardpost location [You are free to change any of these variables without worrying]
