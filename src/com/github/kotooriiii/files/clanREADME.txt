IMPORTANT: Careless editing with the following clan files can cause CORRUPTED DATA,
which can remove or tamper with your clan in-game. PLEASE TAKE CAUTION IF YOU STILL WISH TO EDIT THESE FILES.

Most of the time, if you wish to edit clan information it is best to do so in-game by staff commands.
Only EDIT when the server is offline. Editing while server is online will not save any changes
you made to the file.

The format follows as:
the name of the file is the id of the clan [UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THIS BE CHANGED]
opening the file in notepad++ gives you many attributes
here you can change the name of the clan, tag, friendlyfire, and color [You are free to change any of these variables without worrying]

You can also remove and add players from clan. The ranks are shown in the file. There will be a UUIDs and in paranthesis to show the id of the player.
The paranthesis are there to help you find what player the UUID belongs to.
